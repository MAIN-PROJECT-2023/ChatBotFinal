# Chatbot Training and Interphase

Welcome to the Chatbot Training and Interphase project! This project focuses on building an intelligent conversational partner using the TensorFlow framework.

## Quick Start

### 1. Set Up Your Environment:

Before diving in, let's create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. Here's a quick guide:

**Windows:**

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory (e.g., `cd path/to/your/project`).
2. Create a virtual environment named `venv`:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
3. Activate it:
    ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

**Unix/macOS:**

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory.
2. Create a virtual environment named `venv`:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
3. Activate it:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

### 2. Install Dependencies:

Once your virtual environment is active, install the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

**3. Run Chat:**

To run chat:

```bash
python app.py
